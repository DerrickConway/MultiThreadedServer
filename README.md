# MultiThreadedServer
You are required to implement a multi-threaded file server and logging application that allows a client application to download files using a set of options presented in a terminal user interface. An overview of the application components is depicted below:

## How to Run
```
-Download curl zip.
-Extract the contents (if you have downloaded the correct version you should find curl.exe)
-Place curl.exe in a folder where you keep your software (e.g. D:\software\curl\curl.exe)
-To run curl from the command line. a) Right-hand-click on "My Computer" icon. b) Select Properties.
```

### Goals Achieved 
```
Get the server to connect to the client and read in IP adderess and port 
Read in a file and recieve it 
exit program and get prompt message 
```
##Conclusion 

As i learned a bit about threads and client and server interaction i could not get the blocking Queue working as i did not fully get the code for it.
